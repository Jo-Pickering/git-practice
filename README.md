This was a small, short project to test GitHub workflows as a group before starting our first group project. 
We immediately learnt about Merge Conflicts when we all tried editing the initial ReadMe file at the same time to add our names. It was great fun working out how conflicts worked and we all had a chance to resolve at least one during the course of the project!
